# Learning Go
* **Go is intentionally 'boring' for reliability and readability. However, that means writing idiomatic Go takes understanding, not just syntax.**
* **Go has evolved:** New tools, features, and libraries (like generics) enhance the development experience. This edition teaches you how to leverage them.
* **Improved content:** This edition addresses first-edition shortcomings â€“ better intro chapter, focus on tools, exercises, and more code samples.
* **Backward Compatibility with Innovation:**  Go now has a strategy for introducing changes without breaking existing codebases, keeping it stable yet dynamic.

> **Key Point:** Go keeps its core philosophy while getting even better! This book is your guide to this updated landscape. 


## Who Should Read This Book?

**Who This Book Is For**

* **New-ish to Go:** You know the mascot's cute, maybe dabbled in tutorials, but want to write Go the "right" way.
* **Expanding Your Toolkit:**  You have experience in other languages and want to see how Go's design choices lead to idiomatic Go code.
* **Seasoned Go Devs:** Even experienced folks will find value in sections on newer language features.

**Assumptions**

* **Dev Basics:** You know version control (Git ideally), IDEs, and computer science concepts (concurrency, etc.).
* **Tools:** You can get the code examples (GitHub) and ideally have the Go Playground handy for experimenting.
* **Web Familiarity:**  HTTP knowledge is helpful as some examples involve servers.

> **Key Point** Go has its own flavor. This book isn't just syntax; it's about how Go's design choices shape well-written Go programs.
